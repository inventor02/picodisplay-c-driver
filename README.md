# Pico Display C Driver

This is a port of the Pimoroni C++ drivers for their [Pico Display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack).

I have tried to rewrite it in a similar style to the Pi Pico SDK and replace the "C++-isms" with more "classic" C-style
code.

This project was undertaken as part of the coursework for the Computer Systems II module in
[ECS at the University of Southampton](https://ecs.soton.ac.uk).

Contributions are more than welcome, please submit a pull request.
